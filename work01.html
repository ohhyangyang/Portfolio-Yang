                <p>A HUMAN TOUCH IN MUSICIANS' WORLD</p>
                <br>
                <p>Wusic is a platform helping musicians to find suitable partners for a project, or reverse.

                    There are a lot of amazing musicians worldwide. But, there is a limited community for them to
                    play around or create some awesome thing together. The goal of Wusic is to help musicians to find their
                    soulmates.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>Wusic is a Full-Stack Single-Page Web application, it's done with MERN Stack technology (MongoDB,
                    Express, React & Node.js), it's developed during the last module of Ironhack Bootcamp, and it was
                    awarded as the â€œHonorable Mention".</p>

                <p class="indent">
                    Wusic is the last project I've done during the intense Ironhack Bootcamp, the idea
                    of Wusic came from a conversation between me and a friend of mine who is a musician, he explained to me
                    the problem he's facing in making music, Since his music style is not mainstream, it is not
                    easy for him to find like-minded music partners, so my purpose was aiming to create an app could help musicians to find musical partners which could match
                    their vibes.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p class="indent">
                    At that moment I was very bored of an ordinary design, so though we only had 1.5 weeks before the submission, I still spent 2~3 days on UX/UI design with Figma, in
                    order to create a unique user experience.

                <h2 class="title">What I learnt</h2>

                <p class="small-title">1. Task completion under high pressure and tiredness</p>
                <p>
                    Though I always think I'm a hard worker (a bit workaholic actually), at the end of the Bootcamp,
                    this inhuman intensity level almost reached my limit, and now I look back on the journey, I'm amazed
                    at how fast I've grown, and it has also trained me the determination to conquer against any unknown
                    and
                    difficult situation.
                </p>

                <p class="small-title">2. Process is greater than the result</p>
                <p>
                    If time allows, I still want to improve Wusic. The design and development process could be endlessly
                    going
                    on. After the project submission, I spent a whole weekend refactoring my codes for SASS and web
                    responsive. I believe a good working habit and process will make me go further, and infinitely lead
                    me to a better result.
                </p>

                <p class="small-title">3. Self problem-solving VS Asking for help</p>
                <p>
                    Most of the time, I think programming is a single-person journey and you need to spend a lot of
                    time to learn and digest it.
                    <br>
                    David Espinosa GutiÃ©rrez was the Teacher Assistant of my Bootcamp program and the tutor for my final
                    project.
                    So I didn't really need David to fix my errors or bugs, but instead, he provided a lot of
                    constructive advice for optimizing my project and shared all he knows to support my idea, it's such
                    a pleasure to work with him.
