                <h2 class="title">Experience</h2>
                <p>
                    This is the last project I've done during the intense Ironhack Bootcamp, and at the moment I was
                    bored of ordinary design, so I was aiming to create an unique user experience which matches
                    musicians' vibe.
                    Though we only had one week and a half, I still spent 2~3 days on doing UX/UI design with Figma in
                    order to achieve a better result.

                <h2 class="title">What I learnt</h2>

                <p class="small-title">1. Task completion under high pressure and tiredness</p>
                <p>Though I always think I'm a hard worker (a bit workaholic actually), but at the end of the Bootcamp,
                    this inhuman intensity level almost reached my limit, and now I look back on the journey, I'm amazed
                    at how fast I've grown, it has also trained me the determination to conquer against any unknown and
                    difficult situation.</p>

                <p class="small-title">1. Work with quality</p>
                <p>If time allows, I still want to improve it! The design and develop process could be endlessly going
                    on. After the project submission, I spent a whole weekend refactoring my codes for SASS and web
                    responsive. I believe self-disciplining will make me go further.</p>
