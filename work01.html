                <p>A HUMAN TOUCH IN MUSICIANS' WORLD</p>
                <br>
                <p>Wusic is a platform helping musicians to find a suitable musician for a project, or reverse.

                    There are a lot of amazing musicians worldwide. But, there is limited platform for these people to
                    play around and build up an awesome project or band. Wusic will help musicians to find their
                    soulmates.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>Wusic is a Full-Stack Single-Page Web application, it's done with the MERN Stack technology (MongoDB,
                    Express, React & Node.js), it's developed during the last module of Ironhack Bootcamp, and it was
                    awarded as the â€œHonorable Mention"</p>

                <h2 class="title">Experience</h2>
                <p>
                    <strong>Wusic</strong> is the last project I've done during the intense Ironhack Bootcamp, and at the moment I was
                    bored of ordinary design, and I was aiming to create an unique user experience which could match
                    musicians' vibe.
                    So, though we only had one week and a half, I still spent 2~3 days on UX/UI design with Figma, in
                    order to achieve an exciting result.

                <h2 class="title">What I learnt</h2>

                <p class="small-title">1. Task completion under high pressure and tiredness</p>
                <p>
                    Though I always think I'm a hard worker (a bit workaholic actually), but at the end of the Bootcamp,
                    this inhuman intensity level almost reached my limit, and now I look back on the journey, I'm amazed
                    at how fast I've grown, and it has also trained me the determination to conquer against any unknown
                    and
                    difficult situation.
                </p>

                <p class="small-title">2. Process is greater than result</p>
                <p>
                    If time allows, I still want to improve Wusic. The design and develop process could be endlessly
                    going
                    on. After the project submission, I spent a whole weekend refactoring my codes for SASS and web
                    responsive. I believe a good working habit and process will make me go further, and infinitely lead
                    me to the better result.
                </p>

                <p class="small-title">3. Self problem-solving VS Asking for help</p>
                <p>
                    I think, most of the time, programming is a single person journey and you need to spend a lot of
                    time to learn and digest.
                    <br>
                    David Espinosa GutiÃ©rrez was the Teacher Assistant of my Bootcamp program and the tutor for my final
                    project.
                    So I didn't really need David to fix my errors or bugs, but instead, he provided a lot of
                    constructive advices for optimizing my project and shared all he knows to support my idea, it's such
                    a pleasure to work with him.
